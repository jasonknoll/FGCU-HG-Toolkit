 <b>Well Data Process Automation</b><br>
This version of our first tool will help automate the Google Sheet manipulation process by taking data from the HTML file generated by the sensors and spitting out a Google Sheet with the correct and up-to-date information. 

 <b>Source Files</b><br>
All the Python code for what will be version 1.0 of the well data automation tool is located in the directory: <br> <i>tookit > debug > auto_well_data</i>

<b>Development Enviornment</b><br>
I'm building this software using the <i>Anaconda</i> development envrionment. It's a widely used Python platform in the world of data science. Contact me if you need any help/info setting up the development enviornment if you're ever get curious and want to do so.
